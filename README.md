# Predictive-Analysis-on-Road-Accident-Risks-Based-on-Heterogeneous-Sparse-Data
The intention of this project is to analyse this accidental data-set to identify the accident hot spot areas and take appropriate measures to decrease the rate of the accident and identify the situations in which the accident happens and take precautions to prevent the accident.
